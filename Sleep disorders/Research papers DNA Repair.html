    <strong>Van Dongen et al. (2020)</strong> investigated the impact of night shift work on circadian rhythms and its association with increased sensitivity to endogenous DNA damage, potentially contributing to an elevated cancer risk. This study highlights how disruptions to normal sleep patterns can interfere with the body's natural processes, including DNA repair mechanisms, thereby increasing cancer risk (<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsaa056.024">Van Dongen et al., 2020</a>).</li>

    <strong>Van Dongen et al. (2022)</strong> found that simulated night shift work disrupts the circadian rhythm of genes involved in cancer hallmark pathways and increases endogenous DNA damage. This suggests a potential link between sleep disruption, impaired DNA repair, and heightened cancer risk, underscoring the critical role of maintaining regular sleep patterns for cellular repair processes (<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac079.024">Van Dongen et al., 2022</a>).</li>

    <strong>Morgan et al. (2019)</strong> discussed the association between disrupted circadian rhythms, due to environmental changes and mutations in circadian regulating genes, with increased cancer risk and/or cancer progression. The study supports the role of the cellular circadian clock in coordinating cell division and DNA repair, indicating that sleep, regulated by circadian rhythms, could facilitate DNA repair and potentially reduce cancer risks (<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/clockssleep1040034">Morgan et al., 2019</a>).</li>

    <strong>Paz-Elizur et al. (2019)</strong> provided evidence that a low DNA Repair score is linked with an increased risk of lung cancer, independent of smoking. This suggests that DNA repair capacity could serve as a biomarker for cancer risk, highlighting the importance of mechanisms, potentially including sleep, that can support DNA repair processes (<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jncics/pkz067">Paz-Elizur et al., 2019</a>).</li>

    <strong>Wu et al. (2019)</strong> explored the impact of genetic polymorphisms in DNA repair genes on cancer risk and prognosis. The study found that higher levels of certain genes could influence overall survival and cancer risk, suggesting that enhancing DNA repair mechanisms, potentially through adequate sleep, could be beneficial in reducing cancer risks (<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.7150/jca.30975">Wu et al., 2019</a>).</li>

<p>These studies collectively suggest that maintaining regular sleep patterns and ensuring adequate sleep could be crucial in supporting the body's DNA repair mechanisms, thereby potentially reducing the risk of cancer development.</p>
