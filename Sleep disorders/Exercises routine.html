    <h3>6. Relaxation Techniques (3 minutes)</h3>
    <p>Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or mindfulness for 3 minutes to calm your mind before sleep.</p>

    <h3>7. AveoTSD Usage (if prescribed) (Throughout the night)</h3>
    <p>Follow the usage instructions provided by your healthcare provider or dentist. AveoTSD is typically worn during sleep to reduce snoring and sleep apnea events.</p>
    <h3>8. MyoBrace (if prescribed) (Throughout the night)</h3>
