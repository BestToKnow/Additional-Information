    <h1>Here are five meal plans that incorporate the heart-healthy tips:</h1>

    <p>Each meal plan is carefully crafted to incorporate ingredients that support gut health, vitamin K2, probiotics, berberine, nattokinase, and LDL management, contributing to the reversal of atherosclerosis and overall heart health.</p>

    <h2>Meal Plan 1: Mediterranean-Style Heart Health</h2>
